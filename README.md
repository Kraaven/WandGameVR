# Shape Recognition

I wanted to figure out how i can identify what shape the user's hand is making in VR (3D Space). Hence the creation of this project

## Implementation
- Originally, i made my own algorithm for this project, however, dropping it for Procrustes Analysis due to accuracy reasons.
- The Letters used for comparision are drawn about 10-20 times, and the average of each vertex is reason, creating the "Perfect" human drawn shape.
- I implemented this feature in a spell casting experience, and letter recognition.

You can learn more details from a small informal project report i wrote here:
